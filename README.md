## Description
TrackPacker is a MERN application featuring authentication, user-specific data, and a RESTful API allowing the user to create and manipulate data. Users create an inventory and wishlist of adventure gear items, excursions that they plan to undertake, and create packing lists by adding inventory and wishlist items onto any of their excursions. TrackPacker features responsive, user-focused design,leveraging Material UI's component library.

* Once you have repo cloned and dependencies installed, run  ```npm start``` in the command line to start dev servers on localhost:3000(front-end React UI) and localhost:3001 (back-end Express server).
